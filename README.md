# Annotations App

Annotations are a wonderful way to show first-time users how things work in your application. With the help of annotations, users can identify what each element in your app does, thus eliminating the need to hunt through the details themselves.

This App shows a small demonstration on how to create annotations in React.

## Bonus exercise.
1. Use this app and trigger the annotation when it comes into view using scroll events.
2. Store annotation trigger state in browser (hint: LocalStorage) so that user can see the annotation only once, during his/her first visit.
